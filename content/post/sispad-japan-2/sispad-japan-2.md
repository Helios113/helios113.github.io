## Process simulation - surface etching  

Lado spoke about his ViennaPS. They have created a compact model which interpolates experimental data. I need to read the paper to properly understand. As Lado said, if you don't know about surface etching 15 minutes won't help ðŸ¤£.

## AAAI paper results  

My AAAI paper will recieve a dÐµsicion today! Very excited to find out if my collaborators and I will get an AAAI paper out.
