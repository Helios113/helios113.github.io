## Process simulation - surface etching  

Lado spoke about his ViennaPS. I need to read the paper to properly understand. As Lado said, if you don't know about surface etching, 15 minutes won't help ðŸ¤£.

## Process simulation - surface deposition modelling  

Samsung spoke about how they can replace DFT with ML. They use SimpleNN to predict surface potential. The model thus far works only in a predefined domain. They aim to expand this to have generative capabilites.

## AAAI paper results  

My AAAI paper will recieve a dÐµsicion today! Very excited to find out if my collaborators and I will get an AAAI paper out.
