&lt;p>Today, I am on my way to Kobe. I spent the whole day in Tokyo, and I really enjoyed it. Tokyo is a fantastic place, it has a population of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>14.09 million&lt;/a> people as of 2018. That is double that of my home country!!!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Tokyo, I really wanted to go to the flagship Muji store. Still, to my surprise, it is closed for renovations until a day after I leave Japan. I also wanted to climb Mt. Fuji, but due to time constraints and unfortunate timing, I could not do that, too. So I am definitely coming back 🛩🛩🛩.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thoughts-on-tokyo">Thoughts on Tokyo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apart from those annoying facts, Tokyo has been great. The city centre is more posh and luxurious than Dubai or Doha, yet cheaper than the UK. I am not a luxury shopper, but I want to know if I get a good deal. The food is excellent, as all food bloggers suggest. There are a lot of stunning sights and beautiful shrines. I can only imagine how many more things there are&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is the first day of SISPAD. I am excited to meet everyone and learn more about thermo/mechanical analysis of semiconductors. On Thursday, the 28th is the machine learning session, which is what I am here for. It&amp;rsquo;s also the day of my talk, so it will be great!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first publication</title><link>https://preslav.xyz/p/first-publication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://preslav.xyz/p/first-publication/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://preslav.xyz/p/first-publication/cover.png" alt="Featured image of post My first publication" />&lt;p>I got my first ever publication out.

I recentrly moved away from Jekyl to this new Hugo page. I am super happy with the way it looks and how easy it is to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This page will serve as an additional repository of what I am doing and will hopefully grow to be a useful place for many.&lt;/p>
